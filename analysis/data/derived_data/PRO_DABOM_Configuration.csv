All equipment was purchased by the Kittitas County Conservation District directly from Biomark. Site was installed and will be managed by WDFW personnel. Initial configuration of the site included 3-20ft, Biomark Lite antennas, each spanning the wetted width of the creek. Antenna 1 is upstream, 2 middle, and 3 is the downstream antenna. Antennas 2 and 3 were damaged February 2016 and were replaced in February 2017 with 24 x 8 ft pass-through antennas constructed with 1 inch PEX. Ten inch posts were used on the bottom of the creek to create a backbone for the antennas.  The posts are secured to the substrate with MR-4 anchors.

LMT,110,04,LMT_D,2018-10-15T12:00:00Z,NA,INT,Lower Mainstem Teanaway River,Downstream Array,"The lower Teanaway pit tag array was installed in 2010 near the mouth of the Teanaway river, under the HWY 10 bridge .  The site had MUX with 2 rows of 3-20’ schedule 80 PVC antennas and used solar panels to generate power.  After an historic flow event in the fall of 2015 the decision was made to relocate the site to a more stable location and upgrade the equipment with more durable HDPE antennas and IS1001 readers and controller.  In October of 2018, the site was relocated 200’ below Lambert bridge, 5 miles east of Cle Elum Washington (47.174326, -120.836400).  The IS1001 MTS is powered by a 200 Ah 24V battery bank charged with a 24V, 8A Interacter charger which is connected to grid power.  There are two CAN bus trunk lines ~60’ long that are connected to the upper and lower rows of ACNs.  The submersible enclosures for the IS1001s were constructed by Yakama Nation Fisheries and consist of schedule 40 PVC with various fittings.  The submersibles were pressure tested to ensure a water tight enclosure.  They are located 8’ below each antenna and are daisy chained together.  Hydrovolt plugs are located between each submersible for the CAN bus cabling  and from submersible to antenna allowing each component to detatch under extreme flow conditions.  The CAN bus cabling is routed in a straight line 8’ below each row of antennas and is secured to 3/8” stainless steel cable using zip ties.  The stainless steel cable is secured to the substrate with MR-4 anchors, ~10’ apart.  Both rows of antennas consist of 3, 25’X30” HDPE flat plates constructed by Yakama Nation spanning the entire channel under most flow conditions.  The antennas are secured to the substrate using MR-4 anchors and a combination of NRS and ratchet straps. The site was installed in July 2018 by WDFW and Yakama Nation staff and started collecting data on 10/15/2018 at 13:15.",Instream Remote Detection System,539.284.000,823,47.174326,-120.8364
