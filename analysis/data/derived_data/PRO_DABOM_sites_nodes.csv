SCL,JDA,Spring Creek NFH Adult Ladder,INT,Fish ladder allowing passage from the Columbia River into the adult holding ponds at Spring Creek NFH.  The adult fish ladder at Spring Creek NFH is operational from late August through early October annually.  The detector is approximately 60 meters up the adult ladder and is comprised of three antennas located in separate ladder cells.  All fish entering the facility from the Columbia pass through the antennas and after ladder navigation are sorted and may either be either surplused or spawned.  Some captured adults are returned to the river from the spawn collections (adults with adipose fin present and no coded wire tag).  Released fish are passed through a tube that empties into the Columbia River directly upstream the fish ladder entrance.

SFC,JDA,Cougar DamTailrace SF McKenzie,INT,"The Cougar Dam PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder) detection array is installed in the Regulating Outlet (RO) and turbine tailrace of Cougar Dam on the South Fork McKenzie River in Oregon. The array consists of six antennas: four located on the river-left branch originating from the RO, and two on the river-right side at the turbine outlet. The system employs a Biomark Master Controller along with six individual IS-1001 readers connected to each antenna.    On the RO side, two antennas are ferrite-shielded flat plate antennas designed to focus the electromagnetic field for improved detection efficiency while minimizing interference from surrounding metal structures. The other two are large PEX loop antennas situated just downstream of the RO sill, optimized for detecting tags in a wider detection zone.    On the turbine side, both antennas are floating PEX loop antennas located at the confluence where water from the turbine outlet joins the main river. These floating designs adjust to changing water levels and flow conditions, ensuring consistent detection performance.    The site is grid-powered and operates year-round, providing continuous monitoring of fish migration through the dam's outlets."
SFL,JDA,Shipherd Falls Ladder,INT,"This site is located at Shipherd Falls adult fish ladder, on the Wind River near Carson, WA. The PIT tag interrogation antennas are installed in series in the second and third slots below the adult fish trap. Antenna F1 is upstream of antenna F2. All fish migrating up the fishway pass through these antennas prior to reaching the adult fish trap. When both the interrogation site and trap are in operation, tagged fish that successfully pass the antennas and enter the trap will therefore be logged as interrogations and recaptures in the trap. When the trap is out of operation (May-early June), the tagged fish will be interrogated only. During the winter, when the trap is in operation but the antennas are not, PIT-tagged fish will be reported as recaptured only."

LNR,LNR,Lower Naches River,INT,"This site is a permanent instream PIT tag detection system located at rkm 5.3 on the lower Naches river, 700 meters below Nelson dam. Prior to 10/29/2018, the site consisted of one row of five 28 ft x 3 ft flexible antennas mounted to wooden 2 X 4 backbones and anchored to the riverbed with MR-4 anchors.  Due to extreme flow conditions in the Naches river, 3 inch HDPE antennas were constructed by Yakama Nation Fisheries to replace the flexible antennas. An IS1001 MTS was installed to replace the Qube.  The 3-wire cable was replaced with CAN bus with a 100 ft trunk line running to ACN #5.  All IS1001s are daisy chained together with hydrovolt plugs to allow removal/replacement of individual submersible enclosures and antennas.  Five 25 ft x 31 inch HDPE antennas were installed using the existing MR-4 anchors. Additional anchors were installed to secure the IS1001 enclosures that are anchored 8 ft below the row of antennas.  The site is powered with a 5060 Thermo-electric generator fueled with portable propane tanks."

MCJ,MCN,McNary Dam Juvenile,INT,"This site monitors the McNary Dam smolt bypass and sampling facility. The site operates seasonally for juvenile outmigration and includes antennas in the full flow bypass flume that is often active before and after the sampling facility each year. McNary was a transportation site until 2013. Separation by Code (SbyC) is available to allow researchers to selectively divert PIT-tagged fish. When transportation was conducted from McNary Dam, SbyC acted on all PIT-tagged fish by default to return them to the river, rather than be collected for transportation with untagged run-of-river fish. Researchers could use SbyC to override that default action and instead allow PIT-tagged fish to be treated like the untagged population."
